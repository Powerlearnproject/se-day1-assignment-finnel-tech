Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
A systmatic application of emngineering principles, methods, and tools to the developmentnt of high quality software systems involving design development, testind and dedloyment.
Allows creation of software systems and applications that power different aspects of life.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of of programming languages eg Fortlan.
Making sotware engineering as discipline in the 1960s.
Advent of structured programming.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement- gathering user needs and system requirements
Dsign- creating designs of software architecture interface
Implementetion- building code and build software according to software specifications.
Testing- conducting multiple tests
Maintenance- provividing ongoing support, updates and emhancement.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall- sequential approach with distinct phases (requirements, design, implementetion.) flowing downwards like waterfall 
Agile- iterative and incremental approach focussed on flexibility, collaboration and respnding to change.
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Developer-writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance- ensures software quality by desining and excuting plans.
Project manager- overseas planning, execution and delivery
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
(IDES)- software suits that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code eg Visual studio, Eclipse.
(VCS)- software tools for tracking changes to sourece code and coordinating work among team members eg Github.
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements, tight deadlines, tchnical debt.
Strategies- effective communication,agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks and regular reassessment of product goals.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing- testing individual components or modules of software.
System testing- testing of the whole system.
Acceptance system- testing sofware against user requirement to meet user needs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Write a brief description of a human cell; state the main parts, and their functions in 150 words.
